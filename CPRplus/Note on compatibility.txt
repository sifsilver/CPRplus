CPRplus is compatible with two overhaul mods listed below, but you must make sure to provide a compatibility measure
(If you installed CPRplus through the HIP installer, no further step is necessary for using CPRplus with Historical Immersion Project)

Patch for Historical Immersion Project: (installing CPRplus from the HIP installer recommended): https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/index.php?threads/historical-immersion-project-download-faq.748775/

In addition to other overhaul and portrait mods,  CPRplus is not compatible with mods that modify the following files:

- common/religious_titles/00_religious_titles.txt
